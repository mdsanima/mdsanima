About Me
========

I've been working on VFX and Game Development for the past 10 years now.
I make games, cinematic, commercial, cross platform application Windows Linux Android MacOS and iOS.

3D Animation
------------
I love Houdini Sidefx so much. With this great application I create visual effect like smoke, water, cloth simulation, procedural 3D modeling, digital asset for Unreal Engine 4 and much more. 
Digital asset allow to tweak parameter directly in game engine. In this way, you can make perfect game with only this two excellent software.

Of course I love Blender too. In these software, I make 3D models, sculpt and use this for render my animation. 
I have experienced on Substance Painter UDIM workflow, Zbrush, Coat 3D, Nuke, Black Magic Davinci Resolve, Black Magic Fusion. 

I recently discovered a great software for rendering and layout called Clarisse iFX. 
This software can handle off the limit the biggest 3D scenes ever, without any display problems. 
Handle over 10 trylion polygon and no more lagging on 3D viewport, no more LOD - level of detail.

I really like command line rendering, so much fun.
