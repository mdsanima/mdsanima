For the version number ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` increment the:

- ``MAJOR`` version when you make incompatible API changes. 
    For example with version ``1.11.0`` to version ``2.0.0``.
- ``MINOR`` version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner. 
    For example with version ``0.10.2`` to version ``0.11.0``.
- ``PATCH`` version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes. 
    For example with version ``0.10.1`` to version ``0.10.2``.

Additional markings for pre-release or build metadata are available as extensions of ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` format.
